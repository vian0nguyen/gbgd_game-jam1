# Mailman GDD

## General Summary
Deliver mail to mythological figures that have fallen to our earthly realm. At the Magic Mailbox anything is possible, except Returns to Sender. The communication goes only one way, from the gods and goddesses to the demi gods and fallen deities.

## Objectives
* player experience goals: 
* Key questions:
  * what is the player choice in this game?
  * what is the "conflict"? Self-growth?

### Precedents
* a short hike
* kiki's deliver service
* unpacking
* spiritfarer

## Mechanics

* day/night cycle to illustrate the time passing between sending then recieving a letter (is this real time or is it based on the # of letters you can drop off? maybe 3 in a day)
* heaven - earth: gravity falls/paranorman type strangeness in town results in letters that CTA (ie clean up my tombstone, remember my shrine, offer forgiveness to someone who wronged me)
  * spirit letters have vague earth recipients, use the environment and surrounding people to figure out who the letter is referring to. 
  * spirit letters don't use language only objects (sign searching/fortune telling results)
* earth - earth letters: sent when sender was on earth, recieved when they were in spirit. post humous letters. future letters to self.
* earth - spirit letters: offerings as prayer or seeking guidance.
 * spirit recipients need specific ritual to send to each (i.e. burning, leave at an altar)
 * theres an assumption the sender won't recieve a traditional response but as the mailman you help facilitate the ritual

### idea one
* pick up mail: your mail bag can only fit a certain amount of mail (3 to start)
 * when mail is picked up it's message and effect will overcome you 
* drop off mail - drop off mail at the door, no one appears but dialogue will appear
* keep mail/delay AND recipient asks after it --> these letters go in your personal mail cubby
    * if *good letter*: -
    * if *bad letter*: + --> "ugh, didn't want that anyway."

### idea two
* you pick up mail
 * choose to read it or not 
* deliver it -> get reaction/context from reciever (more context if you've read it; just a reaction if you didn't)

### idea three
* inspired by scott's description of volunteering st the burning man post office
* recipient addresses are vague, somwtimes have nick names
* you must ask around to find context to who the recipient might be
 * "i think youre looking for Phoung two doors down. Or at least she'll know who might know!"
 * "Hmm I dunno if i've heard of a Crane Lady but Next door mentioned some angels that visited some time ago?"

### idea four
* inspired by slice of life and kikis delivery service
* each delivery teaches the player more about themselves, the value of communication and intimacy
* their lore might be similar to mal blum's San Cristobal
* ran away from an indifferent home and is now surrounded by a small community overflowing w care and love for each other

__Game Loop:__

* your bag can hold 5 items
* day cycles - you can pick up + resolve 2 bag trips a day?? or 10 items a day
* Some recipients might ask after mail that they've sent or are waiting to be delivered --> "have you gotten anything from [blank]?
 * Once a recipient asks after mail the more days go by compounds the effect of delaying mail
    
### Mechanics Progression

 #### MVP
 5 mail; 4 townspeople; 2 gods; 2 day cycles
 * day one: spirit - earth, spirit-earth, earth - spirit
 * day 2: earth - spirit, spirit - earth
 
 Player character acts as a proxy/facilitator for spiritual guidance. Gets multiple ways to interpret messages to recipients (spirit - earth) and facilitates ritual (earth - spirit)
