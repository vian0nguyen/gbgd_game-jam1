# Mailman GDD

## General Summary
Deliver mail to mythological figures that have fallen to our earthly realm. At the Magic Mailbox anything is possible, except Returns to Sender. The communication goes only one way, from the gods and goddesses to the demi gods and fallen deities.

-> might move away from mythology and more towards family spirits, elders, town mythos

## Mechanics

* day/night cycle to illustrate the time passing between sending then recieving a letter (is this real time or is it based on the # of letters you can drop off? maybe 3 in a day)
* heaven - earth: gravity falls/paranorman type strangeness in town results in letters that CTA (ie clean up my tombstone, remember my shrine, offer forgiveness to someone who wronged me)
  * spirit letters have vague earth recipients, use the environment and surrounding people to figure out who the letter is referring to. 
  * spirit letters don't use language only objects (sign searching/fortune telling results)
  * after some investigating there are possible choices of who can recieve the message
   * different people have different interpretations of the meaning
    * "who needs this message" over "who does this message go to" 
   * spend time with them to release their spirit?? -- don't want to just spend kindness tokens
