# Mailman GDD

## General Summary
Deliver mail to mythological figures that have fallen to our earthly realm. At the Magic Mailbox anything is possible, except Returns to Sender. The communication goes only one way, from the gods and goddesses to the demi gods and fallen deities.

-> might move away from mythology and more towards family spirits, elders, town mythos

## Mechanics

* heaven - earth: gravity falls/paranorman type strangeness in town results in letters that are guidance, prayer, etc
  * spirit letters have vague earth recipients, use the environment and surrounding people to figure out who the letter is referring to. 
  * spirit letters don't use language only objects (sign searching/fortune telling results)
 * investigate and find who will recieve the message
   * the more people you talk to the more context will be offered in interpretations
   * have different interpretations of the meaning upon gifting
   * "who does this message go to" and "what could it mean"
   * (optional?, nice to have) perform ritual with the obj with them --

* you can ask townspeople about an item in your mailbag
* ask around until you find the valid recipient
