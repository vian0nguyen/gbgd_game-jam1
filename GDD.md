## Mechanics
### idea one
* pick up mail: your mail bag can only fit a certain amount of mail (3 to start)
 * when mail is picked up it's message and effect will overcome you 
* drop off mail - drop off mail at the door, no one appears but dialogue will appear
* keep mail/delay AND recipient asks after it --> these letters go in your personal mail cubby
    * if *good letter*: -
    * if *bad letter*: + --> "ugh, didn't want that anyway."

### idea two
* you pick up mail
 * choose to read it or not 
* deliver it -> get reaction/context from reciever (more context if you've read it; just a reaction if you didn't)

### idea three
* inspired by scott's description of volunteering st the burning man post office
* recipient addresses are vague, somwtimes have nick names
* you must ask around to find context to who the recipient might be
 * "i think youre looking for Phoung two doors down. Or at least she'll know who might know!"
 * "Hmm I dunno if i've heard of a Crane Lady but Next door mentioned some angels that visited some time ago?"

### idea four
* inspired by slice of life and kikis delivery service
* each delivery teaches the player more about themselves, the value of communication and intimacy
* their lore might be similar to mal blum's San Cristobal
* ran away from an indifferent home and is now surrounded by a small community overflowing w care and love for each other

__Game Loop:__

* your bag can hold 5 items
* day cycles - you can pick up + resolve 2 bag trips a day?? or 10 items a day
* Some recipients might ask after mail that they've sent or are waiting to be delivered --> "have you gotten anything from [blank]?
 * Once a recipient asks after mail the more days go by compounds the effect of delaying mail
    
  ### Mechanics Progression

as you advance your relationships with mail recipients they reward you with tips which you can use to upgrade things

as your relationships become more negative mail recipients will slowly stop answering the door to you (forcing you to drop off mail in box or delay thoughtfully)

* level 1 - send letters between meat realm
* level 2 - you send spirit mail to earth people
