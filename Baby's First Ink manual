This manual will explain how to format Ink documents for this game. (this document is a constant work in progress as we add more text/data to pull from the dialogue)

If you haven't already, please download inky from their website to help write dialogue content: https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/

==Tags==
To write tags in Ink, simply write # + tag marker + whatever data you want the game to use.

Example: My hat is blue. #!Jimmy (and the console will print something like "The person speaking is Jimmy" because of the "!" marker that tells the game the name of the speaker)

In the Unity inspector, go to the DialogueManager object and go to the Dialogue Writer component, scroll down till you see "Tags", add one to the "Size" slot, and write in the new marker in the "marker" slot and whatever functions are called when that tag is called (drag and drop in the inspector).

  Your guide to all the tags in the game and what their data is used for.
  
  ~ - Prototype tag.  Mainly used to test the tag system and tag parsing system.  (Currently tells the console that the tag contains whatever text comes after it)
