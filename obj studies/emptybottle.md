a clear glass bottle with a cork at the top.
though empty, it feels extremely dense as if packedful... of nothing.
there's nothing special about the bottle. it's about the size of a wine bottle and heavy like a brick
when holding it to the light there is nothing to be seen inside.
hastily attached to the bottle's neck, "DO NOT OPEN"
it's not like i havent seen this before. what looks empty, like nothing could be anything.
could it be the gift of silence? of reflection? the remains of a moment of longing?
or could it just be an empty bottle?
unimposing, unremarkable, asking for nothing.
