Step One:  Have Object to deliver - who?
Step 2. Talk to people  - who could it be for?
  - first person gives you KEY WORD and RECIPIENT
  - (optional but helpful) everyone else gives you CONTEXT (how do you talk to that person)
Step 3. talk to the RECIPIENT - you know who its for, but why?
  - use KEY WORD to initiate final talk battle
  - if you have CONTEXT use it here to choose correct dialogue responses
  FAIL - you don't learn interesting lore, the person accepts their package and you never learn why
  SUCCESS - you learn what the purpose/meaning package is
Step 4 - Deliver
Step 5 - recieve thank you letters back from RECIPIENTS
