### Mechanics:
* how to talk to someone
* WHo to deliver it to

### Trust System
Demi God Interaction made more important
How do you get someone to open up? --> and reveal information
some responses can be more agressive > how much trust you'd get from someone
dismissive > not upsetting but disrespectful
upsetting but respectful > 
Can checking in w lesser gods give the player more context?

Lock, Object you need to deliver, Who you need to deliver
Talk to townspeople > Get Trust > Get Info > then figure out WHO and WHY
Talk direct to demi god (reciever) > More difficult, lacks context, choice dialog BATTLE

What if you succeed? - start from no trust
What if you fail? - disappoint people, trust doesn't lower

What happens between the ticks?
* prevent the player from sitting and adding ticks?
* 

### Mail Route:
* same route every day
* talk to everyone, check in, optional --> inconsistant outcome when you choose the "right" answer
  * lack of clarity about information 
* figure out information --> get more information
* metroidvania but with words

=Get powers from demi gods=
* move different
* hidden npc
* do ritual

Talk to townspeople > Get Trust > Get Info > then figure out WHO and WHY
Talk direct to demi god (reciever) > More difficult, lacks context, choice dialog BATTLE

MVP:
* build one model
* One person to interact with
*
