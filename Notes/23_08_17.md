Dev Diary:
* kellie started outlining reccurring dialogue for all characters -- needs to be uploaded (some time during the week)!
* stefan recapped his japan trip
* stefan added necessary tags to trigger events, change arcs
* stefan updated kellie's narrative notes documentation and made it easier to read
* vian implemented sophie's art 👍

next time TODO:
* make recurring dialogue for the player (before they select the mailbox)
* have a script for when the player is out of order??????????????????????
* Vian will add more buildings drawings?

*  vian: update scriptable objects, plug in dialogue to where they need to be --> vian can do and ID what needs to be documented
*  stefan: warping system, add map functionality
*  kellie: complete recurring dialogue scripts
*  all: find a way to end the game
*  vian: make a background/texture for the camera, maybe some clouDS? other set dressing????
